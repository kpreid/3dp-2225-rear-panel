# What is it?

This is a replacement rear panel for a Tektronix 2225 CRT oscilloscope. If your scope is missing its rear panel, this will provide rear feet (rubber stick-on feet can be inserted), and cover the semi-exposed back end of the CRT (high voltage!).

It requires 180 mm Ã— 132 mm of print area, and prints in two parts to glue together.

# Caveats

* This probably fits some other models but I'm not the historian to list exactly which ones.

* The rear handle/screw-hole areas lack support, and some of the interior cutouts are unnecessarily deep and nearly intersect the surface, meaning that some of the plastic will fall down and be ugly (but not enough to compromise the strength or cause the print to fail).

* This is not a particularly refined model; I just wanted to get it working and sturdy, and I didn't want to wait for many multi-hour prints. So the fit is not perfect and more plastic is used than probably necessary.

* My oscilloscope was also missing its front feet and pivoting handle. (I vaguely heard that this may be the result of it having been rack-mounted in the past.) Therefore, I have not attempted to match the height of the rear feet to the front, or test that they work with the scope tilted up.
